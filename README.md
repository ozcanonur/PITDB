- Download the mongoDB dump (if you have one)
- Import the dump into mongoDB, name the database pitdb

- In the server directory, create a .env file, Put DB='mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/pitdb' inside the .env file (the address might be different for you, but it should be the same since this is the default address) Also put CLIENT_BUILD_PATH='../../client/build'
